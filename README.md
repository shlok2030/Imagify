# Text‑to‑Image Generator SaaS App

A Full Stack AI web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) which lets users generate images from text prompts, share them in a community feed, and/or download them.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project enables users (creators, marketers, hobbyists) to enter a text prompt (e.g., *“a dreamy sunset over a futuristic cityscape”*) and generate a unique image via an AI image‑generation API. The generated image can then be downloaded, shared, or viewed in a community gallery.
It’s built as a SaaS‑style app: user accounts, dashboard/history, prompt sharing, etc.

---

## 🚀 Features

* User authentication (Sign Up, Login)
* Text prompt input → AI image generation
* Download generated image to device
* Credit‑based usage / monetization flow

---

## 🧮 Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React.js, with Tailwind CSS o
* **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js REST API
* **Database**: MongoDB 
* **AI API**: CLIP DROP API
* **Deployment**: Frontend, Backend: Render
* **Authentication/Security**: JWT tokens, password hashing (bcrypt)

## 🔧 Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository‑url>
cd <project‑folder>
```

### 2. Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file with environment variables. Example:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLIPDROP
```

Start the backend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Frontend setup

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```


Start the frontend:

```bash
npm start
```

### 4. Deployment

* Frontend: Deploy to Render
* Backend: Deploy to Render,
* Database: Use MongoDB Atlas
* Set environment variables in production accordingly

---

## 📌 Usage

1. Visit the homepage
2. Register / Login
3. On the “Create” page, input your text prompt to get a random prompt
4. Click **Generate** → image is generated by the AI API and displayed
5. Download the image or share it with the community
6. If credit‑based usage is enabled: purchase credits → each generation deducts a credit

---

## 🧩 How It Works (High‑Level)

* Frontend sends a POST request with user prompt to backend API
* Backend receives prompt → calls the AI image generation API
* Backend responds to frontend with image URL and metadata
* Frontend displays the image, enables download

* Add more image generation settings (image style, size, filters)
* Add real‑time feedback / loading UI while generation happens
* Add a credit/subscription model with payment gateway integration
* Add leaderboards or rewards for best prompts/images
* Add ability to edit or refine generated images
* Build a mobile app version using React Native
